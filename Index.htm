<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade was an extremely mobile unit and went into action
in many different guises. As a platoon, as a battalion, as part of the 7<sup>th</sup>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>So,
unless the action was undertaken by the entire battalion, various parts of the
battalion could be in 'action' at different places at the same time. Therefore,
without knowing which Company, Platoon and Section he was in, it is very
difficult to know where he was at any given time and the detail below is a
combination of fact and considered assumptions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
assumptions were based on the idea that at Kournine in March 1943, he was in
'C' Company (C Coy) and when injured in July 1944, he was also in 'C' Coy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Additionally,
a Corporal known as 'Pedlar' is mentioned in letters written to him after the
war. 'Pedlar' Gardner is also mentioned a number of times in a book called
'Diary of a Desert Rat' which was written by a rifleman in 'C' Coy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>So
it is assumed he was always in 'C' Coy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>At
the time of his injury in Italy, it seems he was in 10 Platoon, however when
the desert war was over and the battalion moved from North Africa to Italy, the
majority of their transport was taken away and they were changed from a mobile
motor battalion to 'hard infantry'. Instead of a Section truck, carrying 6 or 7
men and the items they needed on a day to day basis, they were transported in a
lorry that carried the entire platoon, with other vehicles carrying their bedding
etc. (They were allowed to keep a few Bren carriers).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>This
change from a mobile battalion to hard infantry, resulted in a re-structuring
of Platoons, so whilst it seems he was in 10 Platoon when in Italy, it is not certain which he was in when in North Africa.</span></p>
