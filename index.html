<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
Rifle Brigade was an old and well-respected regiment. Their training included
teaching their long history and encouraging the feeling of belonging so when in

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>They

on, when operating in their 'flying' columns', it was said that everyone could

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Unlike
most regiments, the Rifle Brigade did not have colours (a flag) as a rallying
point for the troops but used bugle calls instead. This tradition was based
around the idea that their troops would be dispersed when in action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>They
were also know for their 140 paces per minute, 'Quick March'.</span></p>

were small, highly mobile groups that included one or two companies of
infantry, a couple of troops of RA 25 pounders and the RB's anti-tank guns.
They worked behind the enemy lines (up to 60 miles), harassing the enemy or
monitoring their movements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Their

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade was an extremely mobile unit and went into action
in many different guises. As a platoon, as a battalion, as part of the 7<sup>th</sup>
Motor Brigade or as a company (or part of a company) involved in a 'Jock'
Column.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>So,
unless the action was undertaken by the entire battalion, various parts of the
battalion could be in 'action' at different places at the same time. Therefore,
without knowing which Company, Platoon and Section he was in, it is very
difficult to know where he was at any given time and the detail below is a
combination of fact and considered assumptions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
assumptions were based on the idea that at Kournine in March 1943, he was in
'C' Company (C Coy) and when injured in July 1944, he was also in 'C' Coy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Additionally,
a Corporal known as 'Pedlar' is mentioned in letters written to him after the
war. 'Pedlar' Gardner is also mentioned a number of times in a book called
'Diary of a Desert Rat' which was written by a rifleman in 'C' Coy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>So
it is assumed that when in 2 RB he was always in 'C' Coy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>At
the time of his injury in Italy, it seems he was in 10 Platoon, however when
the desert war was over and the battalion moved from North Africa to Italy, the
majority of their transport was taken away and they were changed from a mobile
motor battalion to 'hard infantry'. Instead of a Section truck, carrying 6 or 7
men and the items they needed on a day to day basis, they were transported in a
lorry that carried the entire platoon, with other vehicles carrying their
bedding etc. (They were allowed to keep a few Bren carriers).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>This
change from a mobile battalion to hard infantry, resulted in a re-structuring
of Platoons, so whilst it seems he was in 10 Platoon when in Italy, it is not certain which he was in when in North Africa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

some point, he was associated with the Kings Royal Rifles, although I have seen
nothing to support this and my memory may be failing me. (The KRRC were part of
the 7<sup>th</sup> Motor brigade, so this may have been what he meant).</span></i></p>

had been seconded to the LRDG (Long Range Desert Group who operated behind the

found anything to confirm this but as he was involved in the 'Jock' columns,
operating well behind enemy lines, this was likely.</span></i></p>

Mortaring starts in earnest,, crashes and brief red bursts glow on the upper
slopes. Red and green flares rise from about half way up and the 2 in command
grows quite excited, surmising the success signal, But 'success signal my
foot!” is the opinion of the rest of us, for whenever the geens and reds go up,
or rather and exactly regular number of seconds after, salvos of heavy shells –
probably 105mm – roar through the air like express trains from somewhere over

groups,, most of them badly shaken. The talk of crawling up sheer precipices to
find every level expense swept by machine gun fire, of wounded rolling all the
way to the bottom; of tripwire mines and booby-traps on handgrip ledges; of
areas automatically illuminated on approach by flares and bulbs, immediately
drawing fire, of premature rifle-shots from stumbling men, supposed to have
given the game away; and walls and caves and all sorts of cunning defensive

sent to Egypt. These were formed into an infantry brigade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>In
April 1944, these troops, many of whom were communist sympathisers, mutinied.
They shot some of their officers, who were still loyal to the King of Greece
and imprisoned the rest. They were fully armed and had been ready to go to Italy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>In
response to the mutiny, the 7<sup>th</sup> armoured division, recalled their
tanks (they had previously been handed back ready for the divisions
re-deployment) and along with the Rifle Brigade and 14<sup>th</sup>/20<sup>th</sup>
Hussars (green troops with no battle experience), surrounded the Greek
encampment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>By
this time the Greek troops had taken possession of some high ground overlooking
the camp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
Rifle Brigade undertook the recognisance of the camp and when it was decided to
take the high ground from the Greeks, the RB were tasked with this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
taking of the hill was accomplished by a Company from the RB but their Company

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>There
followed a stalemate and a parley where the Greeks asked for food (as the main
water supply line passed through their camp, they were never short of water).
The response from Brigadier Otto Palmer (and erratic man straight out of England and again with no battle experience), was to tell them that if they did not
surrender, he would send the tanks in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
troops then surrendered. They were disarmed and send into prison camps where it

– Although I don’t understand why, he relinquished his appointment to Lance
Corporal. As he was not discharged from the army until 20/04/1945,
relinquishing his rank would have meant a reduction in his pay from Nov 44 to
April 45.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Additionally
it also seems that at some time, he thought he had been given a field promotion
to full corporal which would have affected his pay and pension. However, there
was no evidence of this and letters to the war office after the war confirmed
the lack of evidence. (I have read about others in his company that had field
promotions but there was no record and they did not get the associated pay
increase).</span></p>

– Apparently, a normal practice for promotion would be 'Acting Unpaid' then
'Acting' (with pay) then 'War Substantive'. Only in the Substantive category
was the rank and pay assured. If you were 'Acting', a move to another position
would result in you returning to your original position.</span></p>

told me that they had had a new arrival into their section and in a letter, he

the fifth mortar arrived, he laid on top of him.</span></p>
